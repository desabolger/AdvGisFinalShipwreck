The AISVTC2023Atlantic.tif file is over 2 gb and github will not allow it to be uploaded.

I have uploaded the file to box (for all to view and download with the link).  

Here is that link: https://duke.box.com/s/imjvh7esyrpwlhsoupy95dtye6xs71i9.

I believe that if all of those files are downloaded to the Data -> Raw file and not renamed, everything should run as normal.

If there are any issues, please let me (Desa!) know, and I can work on them.

Thank you and my apologies for this issue!
